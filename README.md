# blog_api
A blog rest api backend I made using python and django rest framework.

## Features

- Implemented crud operations on blog posts and comments
- Implemented users accounts and authentication using Token authentication method.
- Handled users permissions so only authenticated users can create, edit, delete posts and  also comments on other posts.
- Built a Docker image for the api to ease deployment.
- Environments variables config
- CORS middlewares
